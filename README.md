# Sample Application: Headless Drupal 8 with React Frontend

This project was built to demonstrate a headless instance of Drupal 8 to control the backend, using React to render the information on the frontend.

I created the Drupal 8 instance locally using [Docksal](https://github.com/docksal/docksal) and the React instance using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run project locally:
1. Start Drupal environment
⋅⋅⋅ `fin vm start`
2. Start React environment
⋅⋅⋅ `yarn start`
