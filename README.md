# Sample Application: Headless Drupal 8 with React Frontend

This project was built to demonstrate a headless instance of Drupal 8 to control the backend, using React to render the information on the frontend.

I created the Drupal 8 instance locally using [Docksal](https://github.com/docksal/docksal) and the React instance using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run project locally:

1. Navigate to the `d8-sample-backend` folder and start Drupal vm environment

   `fin vm start`

2. Navigate to the `d8-sample-react` folder and start React environment

   `yarn start`


>**Note** I'm still working on cleaning this up so it can be easier to understand and use.
